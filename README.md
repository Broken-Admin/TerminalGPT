## Why?

Some advantages of using TerminalGPT over the chatGPT browser-based app:

1. It doesn't disconnect like the browser-based app, so you can leave it running in a terminal session on the side without losing context.
2. It's highly available and can be used whenever you need it.
3. It's faster with replies than the browser-based app.
4. You can use TerminalGPT with your IDE terminal, which means you won't have to constantly switch between your browser and your IDE when you have questions.
5. TerminalGPT's answers are tailored to your machine's operating system, distribution, and chip set architecture.

## Pre-requisites

1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. [An OpenAI Account and API key](https://elephas.app/blog/how-to-create-openai-api-keys-cl5c4f21d281431po7k8fgyol0) that you can get for **FREE** with a limited quota (which you'll never get to with personal use).
